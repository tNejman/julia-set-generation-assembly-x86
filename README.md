# julia-set-generation-assembly-x86

This repository contains a small program designed to generate a popular fractal which is Julia set.
Technology used is :
  - declaration of a function in C
  - implementation of the function in x86 assembly
  - linking the body to the declaration

The parameters based on which the fractal is generated can be changed in runtime using keyboard arrow keys; the fractal changes with minimal delay.
